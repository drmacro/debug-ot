# DITA OT Test Project

This is a trivial Eclipse project with a simple main class that runs the OT via
its Java API. This makes it easy to interactively debug the OT's java code.

Requires a separate copy of the OT source project.

The code as written sets the transformation type and other properties
directly but it could be enhanced to take those as command-line arguments
as for the real dita command.
